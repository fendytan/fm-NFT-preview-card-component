## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second project after completed The Odin Project's Foundation.

### Continued development

I still need more practice on CSS Flexbox and CSS grid for positioning of the elements.
I am also still having hard time in understanding position absolute and relative.
